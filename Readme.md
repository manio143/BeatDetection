# Beat detection algorithm
This is a C# implementation of a beat detection algorithm described in [this article on GameDev.net](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/_/technical/math-and-physics/beat-detection-algorithms-r1952/).

It came up as part of my research for [Rise of the Undeaf](//github.com/manio143/RiseOfTheUndeaf).
